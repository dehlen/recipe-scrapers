<p>If you know me you know I love me some homemade lasagna. Or basically just any version of comfort food and recreate to make it a little bit better for you. If you haven&#8217;t had the chance to explore our <a href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healthy-comfort-food/" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthy comfort food</a> category, be sure to do so because there are plenty of meals to fall in love with.</p>
<p>Two of my favorite healthy comfort food makeovers include my famous <a title="The Best Healthy Turkey Lasagna You’ll Ever Eat" href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/the-best-healthy-turkey-lasagna-youll-ever-eat/" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthy turkey lasagna</a> and <a title="Low Carb Zucchini Lasagna with Spicy Turkey Meat Sauce" href="https://www.ambitiouskitchen.com/healthy-low-carb-zucchini-lasagna-spicy-turkey-meat-sauce/" rel="noopener noreferrer">zucchini lasagna</a>. This time, I knew I wanted to make the perfect vegetarian lasagna, so let&#8217;s welcome #AKPumpkinWeek Day 5 with this gorgeous vegetarian spinach pumpkin lasagna!</p>
<p>One of my favorite meals growing up was my mom&#8217;s spinach and butternut squash lasagna layered up with mozzarella cheese and cozy fall flavors. I used to beg her to make it for me and then refuse to share the recipe with anyone because I was SO freaking obsessed. This pumpkin lasagna is basically a version of that but with my own little twist for Pumpkin Week using TWO whole cans of delicious pumpkin puree.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a little sweet, a little savory, plenty of cozy and basically heaven in every single bite.</p>

<h2>Ingredients in vegetarian pumpkin lasagna</h2>
<p>This healthy pumpkin lasagna recipe is packed with sneaky veggies and cozy spices that make it literally the best comfort food for fall &amp; winter. Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll need to make it:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For the pumpkin layer: </strong>this layer has two full cans of <a href="https://amzn.to/3hpUvGM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">pumpkin puree</a> plus cozy spices like <a href="https://amzn.to/3me2pGS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">cinnamon</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3hmTIGm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">nutmeg</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3ipotvS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">ginger</a> &amp; <a href="https://amzn.to/35wjsO6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">allspice</a> that add a delicious hint of sweetness. They pair SO well with the savory &amp; salty ricotta and cheese layers.</li>
<li><strong>For the veggies: </strong>we&#8217;re packing in a whole bag of spinach here for a boost of delicious veggies. You&#8217;ll actually mix it in with the ricotta layer so it&#8217;s the perfect way to sneak in some green for the kiddos!</li>
<li><strong>For the noodles: </strong>I used regular <a href="https://amzn.to/2GGG0RY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">lasagna noodles</a> in this recipe, but you can also use <a href="https://amzn.to/3k6BDxY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">gluten free</a> or <a href="http://amzn.to/2y6LvUF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">whole wheat</a> if you prefer.</li>
<li><strong>For the cheese layer:</strong> Between the layers of noodles is fresh mozzarella cheese, parmesan and a creamy ricotta. You&#8217;ll also add an egg, a bit of <a href="https://amzn.to/2RhZMVS" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener sponsored noreferrer">garlic powder</a>, salt &amp; pepper. This also contributes to the lasagna flavor, so do not skip the cheese (an excellent source of protein!).</li>

<h2>How to make pumpkin lasagna</h2>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 9&#215;13 inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the lasagna noodles for 5-6 minutes, then drain. Immediately lay the noodles flat on an oiled baking sheet or cutting board so you can easily assemble the lasagna when ready.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> While the lasagna noodles are boiling, cook the spinach: add ½ tablespoon olive oil to a medium pan or skillet and place over medium heat. Add spinach, season with a little salt and pepper and cook until spinach wilts down. Add to a medium bowl and allow to cool for a minute or two.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the small bowl, add the spinach, ricotta, egg, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Set aside.</p>

<h2>How to Freeze Pumpkin Lasagna: two different ways</h2>
<p>One thing I absolutely love about this pumpkin lasagna is that it&#8217;s freezer friendly! There are two methods to freezing lasagna:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bake first, then freeze.</strong> You can either bake it first, then cool to room temperature, slice into servings, place in freezer safe containers and then freeze. Or you can bake it, bring to room temp, and then freeze the entire pan. Just make sure you double wrap it so the lasagna does not dry out. This is assuming you are freezing the entire pan. Once ready to reheat, thaw it out. Then bake, covered at 350 degrees F for 30-45 minutes or until heated through.</li>
<li><strong>Freeze before baking: </strong>To freeze before baking, simply assemble the lasagna as written in the instructions, then double wrap with plastic wrap and foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Once ready to bake, thaw out then bake according to instructions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Personally I like to cook mine first, then freeze in individual portions, so I can take it out for meals or for lunch as needed. I just reheat my serving in the microwave until warm, about 2 minutes. YUM.</p>

<p>Abra and I enjoyed this pumpkin lasagna for almost two weeks worth of lunches and we were not mad about it. Top your serving with a little extra parmesan for good measure.</p>
<p>Feel free to mix in some of your favorite veggies or even mushrooms for an additional boost of savory flavor. Sage is also delicious in here for topping.</p>

		<p><strong>Two ways to freeze lasagna:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Bake first, then freeze.</strong> You can either bake it first, then cool to room temperature, slice into servings, place in freezer safe containers and then freeze. Or you can bake it, bring to room temp, and then freeze the entire pan. Just make sure you double wrap it so the lasagna does not dry out. This is assuming you are freezing the entire pan. Once ready to reheat, thaw it out. Then bake, covered at 350 degrees F for 30-45 minutes or until heated through.</li>
<li><strong>Freeze before baking: </strong>To freeze before baking, simply assemble the lasagna as written in the instructions, then double wrap with plastic wrap and foil and freeze for up to 3 months. Once ready to bake, thaw out then bake according to instructions.</li>

This is delicious.  There is a lot that could go wrong with a pumpkin lasagna, but not on Ambitious Kitchen! The recipe delivers on balanced flavors. I doubled the spinach (from frozen) and added a thingy of (sautéed) mushrooms. The recipe can hold the extra veggies.</p>

As someone who has never had spiced pumpkin ever (not a popular or common dish in Australia) I was apprehensive to try this but the pictures just looked too good to pass up! </p>
<p>I&#8217;m so glad I did make this as it was absolutely delicious! I didn&#8217;t buy tinned pumpkin puree as I don&#8217;t think you can get it here, rather I made it myself and it still turned out wonderfully! </p>
<p>There is not a thing I would change about this dish, Would definitely reccomend giving it ago!</p>
<p>This is now a favourite of mine!</p>

    <p>This sounds so delicious. I have fresh kale in the house. Do you think that might work in place of the spinach or will it be too tough even after sauteeing? Thank you!</p>

Made this for a “fall” theme potluck and guests were raving and asking for the recipe! I did use no-boil noodles instead of regular (sorry, I’m that lazy sometimes) but it tasted fantastic! Very nice to have a SAVORY pumpkin dish in the fall baking lineup! Thanks, Monique!</p>

Tasty and easy!  I made a half batch since there are just three of us and this lasted us two meals.  Delicious and comforting.  Perfect for cold fall nights.  And a great way to switch up the pasta /lasagna game.</p>

This is so tasty! I actually used 1/8&#8243; butternut squash slices in place of noodles because I had one on hand and wanted to experiment. It paired really well with the pumpkin and spice flavors. I halved the recipe (kept the spice amounts the same) in an 8&#215;8 dish and baked it the same as indicated in the recipe.</p>

I made this last night for a dinner party and it was a huge hit! I was kind of nervous making it for the first time for so many people, but everyone loved it. The pumpkin is soooo good, and not overpowering at all. I will definitely be making it again! Thanks Monique!</p>

Hubby was super hesitant about this one when I told him what was in the recipe. But he loves it and so do I! Can&#8217;t wait to make (and eat) it again!</p>

    <p>Thank you for sharing your recipe. Enjoyed a holiday spin (pumpkin) to traditional lasagna. Used a tofu-ricotta in place of the regular ricotta (not a fan of ricotta) and added roasted pumpkin spiced kabocha pumpkin/red onion to the dish. I also used 1 can of pumpkin puree (all I had) with the same amounts of spices with a little more unsweetened almond milk. Moving forward &#8211; I would add more salt to either the water when cooking the pasta, roasted veggies, or the tofu-ricotta. It needed more salt somewhere in the recipe. Thank you for sharing this recipe!</p>

I love your website and blog!!<br />
I want to try your scrumptious recipe for Thanksgiving dinner&#8230;<br />
Does it still come out fantastic if baked the day before? I plan on refrigerating the lasagna til next day; then heat it before dinner.  Thanks for your wonderful recipes!</p>

This pumpkin spinach lasagna was delicious! Everyone at my table loved it, even my doubting spouse. It wasn&#8217;t heavy, so it was perfect for an after thanksgiving meal. The only thing I changed was using no-boil noodles. And I wasn&#8217;t sure where the 5th one in each layer went, so I just used 4 per layer. I also forgot the sage or parsley, even though I have both.</p>

This recipe is amazing! I’ve already made it twice &#8211; once adding Italian sausage and once keeping it vegetarian. Delicious both ways and everyone I’ve served it for has loved it!! My husband and I actually prefer this to regular lasagna because we don’t end up with stomachaches from the acidity from tomato sauce. Such a great alternative to traditional lasagna!!</p>

I am making this for the second time right now.  The flavors in this recipe are amazing!  I never would have thought that this combination would be so delicious.  My whole family loves it!  And this has got to be the easiest lasagna recipe that I have ever made, which makes it even more of a winner.  Thank you for all of your wonderful recipes!!</p>

    <p>I personally used less nutmeg and more spinach, but it turned out really well. I also just got a pumpkin from the market and used that which turned out really well, I recommend trying this recipe because it´s definitely something new and different!</p>

As always with your recipes, this lasagna was incredible! I made it just as the recipe said, but I had to make my own pumpkin puré since we dont have that in Denmark. It was so creamy and comforting and it actually didn&#8217;t feel super heavy. Much to my surprise, even the teenager loved it, he is usually all about meat!! Will definitely make again. Thanks for the awesome recipe!</p>

Delicious! Monique’s recipes have literally never let me down and this one is no exception. I made a half batch (used an 8&#215;8 pan) and it turned out wonderfully! I didn’t have all the spices separately so subbed 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead for my 1/2 batch pumpkin layer and it worked perfectly. Even my picky husband who was skeptical about the recipe said it was the best lasagna he’s ever had and has been eating leftovers for days.</p>

SO GOOD. Substituted zucchini strips for the noodles, added broccoli and mushrooms in between layers. Served with green salad. Amazing.</p>

I’m a meat lover but have been trying to incorporate more vegetarian meals into my routine. It’s so satisfying and I don’t miss the presence of meat at all. This has become one of my favorite pasta meals and a huge hit in my house.</p>

    <p>Loved this recipe. Made it last night with my partner for a &#8220;date night&#8221; and the slightly sweet pumpkin sauce went so well with the savoury cheese. I didn&#8217;t modify the recipe at all since this was my first time making it, but I think next time I&#8217;ll cook up some ground turkey to add to the pumpkin sauce. Only made 8 servings for us (4 if you eat the serving size my boyfriend does!). A definite keeper!!</p>

I started following Ambitious Kitchen last year and have made at least 20 of her recipes but this by far one of my favorites! I look forward to making it every fall. The leftovers freeze great! The first time I made it I followed the recipe, but the second time I added a can of mushrooms for some extra texture! I recommend making this a part of your fall dinner rotations</p>

    <p>We had this for dinner tonight.  I couldn&#8217;t wait!  I told my hairstylist about this yesterday and before I finished saying, &#8220;pumpkin lasagna&#8221; she was saying, &#8220;yum!&#8221; so you know the whole idea is a winner.   I followed the recipe exactly but&#8230;. I ended up using 12 noodles.  I overlap my noodles and I like noodles so six per layer seemed perfect.  I also used less cheese.  I LOVE cheese but lasagna recipes seem to just go over the top sometimes.  I used 2 cups (8 oz) of mozzarella and a little less than 15 ounces of ricotta.  Not sure how much parmesan.  It was plenty cheesy.<br />
What I do like and would add more of is nutmeg and pepper.  I never liked pepper until &#8220;middle age&#8221; but I sure love it now and it seems to work here.<br />
My recommendation is to follow the recipe for seasoning every step, and even add extra!<br />
The recipe is easy.  Perhaps it seems like a lot of ingredients but just gather them all up before hand and you&#8217;ll fly right through this!<br />
Both the guys in my family enjoyed it despite a little nose wrinkling when I said the name of the dish (so unsophisticated! LOL).  I find they have these preconceived notions about food that simply don&#8217;t hold up when they taste the actual dish they thought was too, &#8220;weird&#8221; sounding.<br />
Now, tomorrow I will be sending some of this home with my college daughter who will be delighted by both the name and the taste of this dish!</p>

Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  This seemed so easy and the picture was so cute I decided to throw caution to the wind and give it a try.  I was not disappointed.  While it took a little bit to get used to the taste of cinnamon and nutmeg with cheese, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It seems filling and while I swear I think I’m eating a dessert (due to the cinnamon/ nutmeg/ allspice/ pumpkin connection), it is truly a cheesy lasagna with all of the lasagna “good feels” you normally get.  If I didn’t give up bread for a month, I’d making sure to have come cornbread or a buttery roll to top it off.   I can’t wait for dinner so I can indulge in more than a taste.  Definitely worth the 5 star.</p>

there are a few secret ingredients that make this french toast truly extraordinary and out of this world addicting: coconut milk (or another non dairy milk), a hint of almond extract and EXTRA cinnamon! choose your bread, give it a dip in the sweet cinnamon batter, throw it on the griddle until golden and then enjoy with your fav toppings!
